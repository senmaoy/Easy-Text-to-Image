## Repoduced-Results-of-text-to-image-models

We would like to maintain a list of repoduced results of text-to-image models. Please feel free to [open an issue]to add your results.

### Submit your results as a new issue and volunteers will add them to the summary list.
The results of each person matters. You are encouraged to submit your results and join us to help more people.
